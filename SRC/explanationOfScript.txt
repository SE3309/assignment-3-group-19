This script uses faker in python to create fake data. The script establishes
a connection to the database using the mysql connector, and takes in the 
password, database, and user. It then inputs all of the data into the database
part by part. It does this by using the functionality of faker and random to 
generate random names, choices, numbers, etc. The inputs are entered in a
 specific order to minimize conflicts in the inputs, in terms of foreign keys.
The data is created using loops, and inserted with sql statements. There are
 some cases of if statments to make sure that the inputs are not violating 
 any rules set by the database
